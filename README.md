# Vulnerability Detection

## Data

This directory contains the datasets used. The `raw/` directory contains the raw data from the Devign paper. The authors released the qemu and ffmpeg datasets.

## Preprocessing

### Step 1: Separate JSON to datasets

The raw data is processed by `preprocess.py`, which writes to `processed/`. This creates a structure like this:

```
data/
    processed/
        ffmpeg/
            1.cpp
            2.cpp
            ...
            labels.csv
        qemu/
            1.cpp
            2.cpp
            ...
            labels.csv
    raw/
        dataset.json
```

The cpp files contain the code, which will be processed by [`astminer`](https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/astminer), which converts them to sequences. The CSV files contain `file` and `target` columns.

Now, clone the [`astminer`](https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/astminer) repo

```
git clone https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/astminer.git
```

Then, run `code2vec.sh`. This will likely need a machine with a lot of memory. 

Next, clone the `code2vec` repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/tech-srl/code2vec.git
```

Then, split this data into train/test/validation splits for code2vec:

```
python3 split.py
```

This will write three files, `dataset.{train,test,val}.txt` in `./data/preprocessed/{qemu,ffmpeg}`. Now, preprocess the data:

```
cd code2vec/
cp ../code2vec_preprocess.sh ./preprocess.sh
./preprocess.sh
```

Next, update the `train.sh` file in the `code2vec/` directory. Only one line needs updating, that is:

```
data_dir=./data
```

The above is the updated version. Finally, run `./train.sh` to train the `code2vec` models. We move the final code2vec data to `data/code2vec`, and the models to `models/`.
